            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the first alpha release of Block Wrangler!</p>
<p>The few of you who followed the <a href="https://github.com/camplowell/block_properties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous repository</a> might be wondering why I started over like this.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I discovered that <code>block.properties</code> requires block IDs to be mutually exclusive, and the previous system wasn't capable of ensuring that.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>In fact, changing the old system to be capable of this would have required a full rewrite anyways, so I decided to start over.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The old system required me to write and maintain a custom code interpreter, which isn't ideal for a project whose goal is <em>not</em> to create a new programming language.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that to say, I started over, and I'm pretty happy with the results.</p>
<p>In addition to rectifying those pain points, I also managed to squeeze out a few more features:</p>
<ul>
<li>I added the optional <code>fuzzy_tags</code> feature, which allows the library to tell you if you misspelled a tag, or if it's a tag that doesn't exist.</li>
<li>It's now possible to import block types and tags from mods and new versions of the game using the <a href="https://wiki.vg/Data_Generators" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">data generator</a>.</li>
<li>Tags can now do things like include all blocks that have a certain property, or whose name matches a certain pattern.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>...as long as you've registered the blocks before you define the tag.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>better progress bars!</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a few ideas on my wishlist for future releases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve the documentation for the project, of course</li>
<li>Add one or more project templates to help shaderpack developers get started with Block Wrangler</li>
<li>Add more preset tags for features that are commonly used in shaderpacks</li>
<li>Numerical flags support (<code>int emission_brightness(int block_id)</code>)</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>
