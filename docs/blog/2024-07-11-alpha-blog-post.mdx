Welcome to the first alpha release of Block Wrangler!

The few of you who followed the [previous repository](https://github.com/camplowell/block_properties) might be wondering why I started over like this.

There are a few reasons for this:
- I discovered that `block.properties` requires block IDs to be mutually exclusive, and the previous system wasn't capable of ensuring that.
	- In fact, changing the old system to be capable of this would have required a full rewrite anyways, so I decided to start over.
- The old system required me to write and maintain a custom code interpreter, which isn't ideal for a project whose goal is *not* to create a new programming language.

All that to say, I started over, and I'm pretty happy with the results.

In addition to rectifying those pain points, I also managed to squeeze out a few more features:
- I added the optional `fuzzy_tags` feature, which allows the library to tell you if you misspelled a tag, or if it's a tag that doesn't exist.
- It's now possible to import block types and tags from mods and new versions of the game using the [data generator](https://wiki.vg/Data_Generators).
- Tags can now do things like include all blocks that have a certain property, or whose name matches a certain pattern.
	- ...as long as you've registered the blocks before you define the tag.
- better progress bars!

## What's next?

I have a few ideas on my wishlist for future releases:
- Improve the documentation for the project, of course
- Add one or more project templates to help shaderpack developers get started with Block Wrangler
- Add more preset tags for features that are commonly used in shaderpacks
- Numerical flags support (`int emission_brightness(int block_id)`)
