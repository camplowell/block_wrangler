# Quickstart

## New Projects
For new projects, we recommend using our shaderpack template.
It includes the bare necessities for a shaderpack, as well as some infrastructure to make it easy to run Block Wrangler.


### Prerequisites
Our template uses a command-line utility called [cookiecutter](https://pypi.org/project/cookiecutter/) to provide additional flexibility when starting a new shaderpack using Block Wrangler.

To install it, run:
```bash
pipx install cookiecutter
```
### Create a Repository
Create a new repository in your version control system of choice.
Clone your repository to your local machine, but **don't `cd` into it just yet!**

In the enclosing folder, run this command to populate your new repository with the template:
```bash
cookiecutter gh:camplowell/shader_templates -f
```
:::tip
This template includes a `.gitignore` file to prevent committing virtual environments, cache files, and other things you probably don't want to commit.
:::

Block Wrangler is ready to use! Don't forget to commit and push your changes to your repository.

## Existing Projects
To add Block Wrangler to existing projects, you can install it from your package manager of choice, or from source:

### Installation

<TabItem value="install_venv" label="virtual environment">
```bash
python -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install block-wrangler
```

To get more detailed error messages when something goes wrong, add `[fuzzy_tags]` to your install command, like so:
```bash
pip install block-wrangler[fuzzy_tags]
```
</details>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="install_user" label="user-wide">
```bash
pip install --user block-wrangler
```
:::note
Installing libraries globally is generally not recommended.

To get more detailed error messages when something goes wrong, add `[fuzzy_tags]` to your install command, like so:
```bash
pip install --user block-wrangler[fuzzy_tags]
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="install_source" label="from source">
```bash
cd central/folder
git clone https://github.com/camplowell/block_wrangler.git
cd your/shaderpack
pip install -e central/folder/block_wrangler
```
:::note
Installing from source will not generate a portable requirements.txt file, so be aware before publishing your shaderpack on Github.  
However, it will allow you to create custom versions of Block Wrangler for your own use, or to contribute to the project.

```bash
pip install -e 'central/folder/block_wrangler[fuzzy_tags]'
```

</Tabs>

### Repository maintenance

Add [this `.gitignore` file](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Python.gitignore) to your repository to prevent committing virtual environments, cache files, and other things you probably don't want to commit.


Generate a requirements.txt file using:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

This file will be used by contributors to ensure they have the same dependencies as you.

### Configuration

At the root of your shaderpack, create a `block_properties.py` file with the following contents:
```python title="block_properties.py"
from block_wrangler import *
from pathlib import Path


shaderpack_root = Path(__file__).parent

def main():
	tags = load_tags()

	mapping = BlockMapping.solve({
		'sway': tags['sway'],
		'sway_bottom': tags['sway/lower'] + tags['sway/short'], # Tags can be combined with the +, -, and & operators
		'crops': tags['minecraft:crops'], # Vanilla tags are included
		'water': blocks('minecraft:water') # Individual blocks can also be referenced by name
	})

	with shaderpack_root.joinpath('shaders/block.properties').open('w') as f:
		f.write(mapping.render_encoder())
	with shaderpack_root.joinpath('shaders/util/block_properties.glsl').open('w') as f:
		f.write(mapping.render_decoder())

if __name__ == '__main__':
	main()
```

## Usage

run `python block_properties.py` to generate the block properties and decoder GLSL files.
