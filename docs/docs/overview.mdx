# Overview

## What is Block Wrangler?

Block Wrangler is a Python library that helps shaderpack developers manage block IDs.

It allows you to:
- Attach boolean properties to blocks or block states that can be used in shaders
- Easily add or remove features from your shaderpack without manually editing the block IDs
- Guarantee that block IDs are mutually exclusive, so that shaders can be written without worrying about collisions

## Core Types

### Tags
Block Wrangler uses **tags** to generate meaningful groups of blocks.
They can be defined in terms of specific blocks, other tags, or a combination of both.

Vanilla Minecraft includes a number of tags, such as `minecraft:crops` and `minecraft:logs`, which can be used to represent groups of blocks.

Block Wrangler also includes a number of common tags, such as `sway` and `lights`, which can be used to kickstart your own definitions.

### Flags

A **Flag** represents a named property that is exposed to shaders.
When defining a flag, you can specify a set of blocks that it applies to by using a combination of tags, filters, and marnually entered collections of blocks.

### Mappings

Block Wrangler uses **mappings** to convey Flags to shaders.
This is the only part of Block Wrangler that knows about the numerical IDs of blocks, and is used as part of the export process.

### Block types

A **block type** is a class that represents a specific type of block, such as `minecraft:stone` or `minecraft:oak_log`.
Its definition includes its full name and all of its properties.

### Block states

A **block state** is a specific instance of a block type, such as `minecraft:oak_log:axis=y`. It includes values for all of the block's properties.
