# Custom Blocks

Block Wrangler includes all vanilla blocks, but you can also add your own.
To do this, you'll need to create a `BlockType` object.

## Creating a block type
When constructing a `BlockType` object, you'll need to provide a few things:
- The namespace of the block
- The name of the block
- A dictionary of properties and their possible values (all strings)

For example:
```python
from block_wrangler import BlockType
my_block = BlockType('custom', 'my_block', {'my_property': ('true', 'false')})
```

Then you need to register the block type with the library if you want it to show up anywhere that uses the `gather_blocks` function:
```python
register_block_type(my_block)
```
:::warning
Tags gather block types when they are defined, so make sure you register any blocks before calling `load_tags()`!
