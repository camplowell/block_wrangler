# Finding Blocks

Sets of block states are represented by `BlockCollection` objects (usually the `Blocks` class).
There are several ways to find blocks in order to use them in flags.

## Literal blocks

You can use the `blocks` function to find blocks and block states by name:
```python
blocks('minecraft:oak_leaves', 'minecraft:redstone_ore:lit=true')
```

## Tags

Tags are preset functions used to find blocks and block states.
You can find a list of block states within a given tag by indexing into a tag collection:
```python
tags = load_tags() # Load pre-defined tags from the BlockWrangler library
tags['minecraft:leaves'] # Find the tag named 'minecraft:leaves'
```

> If you installed Block Wrangler with the `[fuzzy_tags]` option, the library will include more detailed error messaging if you misspell a tag!

## Gathering blocks

Sometimes you may want to get all the blocks that meet certain criteria.
For example, you may want to get all blocks with a certain property, or all blocks that contain a certain string in their name.

To do this, you can use the `gather` function.

### Searching by an arbitrary filter
To search for blocks that meet an arbitrary filter, you can a function to the `type_filter` argument.  
It should take a `BlockType` and return a boolean indicating whether the block should be included in the result.

For example:
```python
oak_blocks = gather_blocks(type_filter = lambda block: block.name.startswith('oak'))
vanilla_blocks = gather_blocks(type_filter =lambda block: block.namespace == 'minecraft')
```

### Searching by state
To search for blocks that meet a state filter, you can pass a `StateFilter` to the `state_filter` argument.  
A state filter is a function that takes a `BlockType` and returns a boolean indicating whether the block should be included in the result.

For example:
```python
lit_blocks = gather_blocks(state_filter = lambda state: state.lit == 'true')
```

### Searching by signature
Sometimes you may want to get all the blocks with a certain property, regardless of its value.
For example, you may want to get all blocks that have a `lit` property that can be either `true` or `false`.

To do this, you can pass a subclass of `BlockState` to the `signature` argument.  
Any subclasses should define certain properties and their possible values.

As a bonus, this will add type hinting to the function you pass to `state_filter`!

For example:
```python
class Lightable(BlockState):
	lit: Literal['true', 'false']

lightable_blocks = gather_blocks(signature=Lightable)
```
