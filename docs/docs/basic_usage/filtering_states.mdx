# Filtering States

Sometimes you may want to further narrow down an existing block collection based on its state.
To do so, you can use the `where` function.

```python
logs = gather_blocks(type_filter=lambda block: block.name.startswith('log'))
vertical_logs = logs.where(lambda block: block.axis == 'y')
```

## Filtering for missing properties

If a block state doesn't have a certain property, it will return the sentinel value `BlockState.MISSING`.
You can use this to find blocks that don't have a certain property, or to only exclude blocks that have the wrong value for a property, but ignore blocks that don't have it at all.

For example:
```python
tags = load_tags()
lights = tags['lights']
on = lights.where(lambda state: state.lit in [BlockState.MISSING, 'true'])
```
