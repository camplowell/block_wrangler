# Combining Blocks

Block collections can be combined using a few binary operators.

The `+` operator results in a new collection containing all the blocks in either input.  
The `-` operator results in a new collection containing all the blocks in the first input, but not the second.  
The `&` operator results in a new collection containing all the blocks in both inputs.
