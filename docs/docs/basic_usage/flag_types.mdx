# Flag Types

Flags are functions that can be used to query information about a block inside a shader.

They come in two flavors:

## Boolean Flags

Boolean flags result in a function with the following signature:

```glsl
bool flag(int id)
```

They are declared by handing the BlockMapping constructor a single block collection.  
For example:
```python
BlockMapping.solve({
	'flag': tags['minecraft:flowers'] + blocks('minecraft:leaves')
})
```

## Series Flags

Series flags result in a function with one of two signatures:

```glsl
int flag(int id)
```
or
```glsl
float flag(int id)
```

They are defined by passing a `Dict[int|float, BlockCollection]` to the `SeriesFlag` constructor.  
For example:
```python
BlockMapping.solve({
	'flag': {i:tags['lights/{i}' for i in range(1, 16)]}
})
```
